# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
Notebooks for different variations of GAN networks. The purpose of this repository is primarily for self education. 
## GANs for MNIST
I developed two GANs in collaboration with my peer BÃºgvi Benjamin Magnussen for a university project.  
The first version uses dense networks for both the discriminator and the generator network. (Closely follows the original GAN paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)  
The second version is a DCGAN inspired by the official tensorflow tutorial. (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan)

## Advanced DCGAN for generating drawn Faces
This version is more sophisticated compared to the other two versions. It has many more layers and uses residual blocks. (inspired by https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04802.pdf)
It also generates images in higher resolution (256x256).  
The dataset used for training is selfmade. I primarily used faces from Kyoto Animations. The dataset can not be shared due to copyright reasons.

Note that unfortunately the colouring is off as i accidentally saved the images in grayscale. Rerunning the network however is quite tedious (4 minutes per epoch), so I decided not to.
