# GAN
Notebooks for different variations of GAN networks. The purpose of this repository is primarily for self education. 
## GANs for MNIST
I developed two GANs in collaboration with my peer BÃºgvi Benjamin Magnussen for a university project.  
The first version uses dense networks for both the discriminator and the generator network. (Closely follows the original GAN paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)  
The second version is a DCGAN inspired by the official tensorflow tutorial. (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan)
